# Davies_etal_NGeo_2019_Datasets

In the first folder, "hoggard", you will find an updated compilation of residual topography measurements from Hoggard et al. (JGR, 2017). See supplementary information of our manuscript for key information. Point-wise (spot) data is included as 2 files: (i) circles.dat, for locations that incorporate a crustal correction; and (ii) triangles.dat, for locations that do not. Shiptrack.dat includes all shiptrack-based estimates of residual topgoraphy. 

In the second folder, "models", you will find simulation output for:

(i) the case with shallow strucutre;
(ii) the case without shallow structure;

For both cases, we include the global synthetic topography simulation output, and the synthetic topography sampled at the spot and spot & shiptrack locations only. Note that for the model incorporating shallow structure, we also include our estimate of the dynamic "flow-related" topography, underpinning Fig. 3 of the main manuscript. Columns: Lat, Lon, Value (km).

In the third folder, "residual topography", you will find the grids plotted in Supp. Fig. 5 of our manuscript, up to lmax = 50 (Supp. Fig. 5a) and lmax = 3 (Supp. Fig. 5b).  Columns: Lat, Lon, Value (km).
